# odin-recipes
Foundations course
Project: Recipes

This *Recipes* project is primarily designed to practice HTML lessons from the Odin Project, but there's inherent *git* practice involved. In this project, I'll develop my HTML and git skills while building a basic recipe website. In time, additional lessons will cover CSS and Javascript.

At first, the website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website will initially look pretty nasty, but will look better as subsequent lessons are completed.
